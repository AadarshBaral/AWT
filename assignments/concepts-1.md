# Concept Review

## HTTP Methods & HTTP Status Codes

**HTTP Methods** - These are actions that can be performed on resources via HTTP. Common methods include:
- **GET**: Retrieve data from the server.
- **POST**: Submit data to be processed to the server.
- **PUT**: Update or replace existing data.
- **DELETE**: Remove data from the server.

**HTTP Status Codes** - These are issued by a server in response to a client's request. Common codes include:
- **200 OK** – The request has succeeded.
- **404 Not Found** – The server cannot find the requested resource.
- **500 Internal Server Error** – The server encountered an unexpected condition.
- **403 Forbidden** – The server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.

## CSS Selectors

- **Element Selector** - Targets all elements of a specific type (e.g., `p`, `div`).
- **Class Selector (`.classname`)** - Selects elements with a specific class.
- **ID Selector (`#idname`)** - Selects a unique element with the given ID.
- **Attribute Selector** - Targets elements with a specific attribute (e.g., `[type="text"]`).

## GIT Basics

- **init** – Initializes a new Git repository.
- **add** – Adds changes to the staging area.
- **commit** – Saves the staged changes to the repository with a message.
- **push** – Uploads local changes to a remote repository.
- **pull** – Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository.
- **clone** – Makes a copy of a repository into a new directory.
- **branch** – Creates or switches to a new branch.

## Callback & Higher-Order Function

- **Callback** – A function passed into another function to be executed later.
- **Higher-order function** – A function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function.

## Array Methods

- **filter** – Creates a new array with elements that pass a test.
- **map** – Creates a new array with the results of calling a function on every element.
- **forEach** – Executes a function for each array element (does not return a new array).
- **push** – Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.
- **pop** – Removes the last element from an array.
